Display of population density for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts

This project creates a 3D graphic that displays the population density for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, divided into 400 meter (1/4 mile) hexagons.
This project was created by following Spenser Shein's Youtube Tutorial, "Rayshader Tutorialâ€”Florida Population Density" (https://youtu.be/zgFXVhmKNbU), then by customizing colors, shadows, text, and of course, data used (Florida -> Massachusetts).
The data used for this project can be accesed on Kontur's website or by following this link: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/kontur-population-united-states-of-america.
